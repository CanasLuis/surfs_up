# surfs_up

##Purpose
Almost every decision that is taken in the business world has passed through a Data Analysis, in this time we want to know if our bussiness would be a great idea looking at the weather tendencies. We are looking for hot weather because want to decide if its feasible to put a surf shop. It is impossible to guess how the weather would be like in the future, however we have a lot of tools and stadistics from past days, weeks and years that can provide the information we need in order to estimate what we will be facing. But that´s not it, we can have a good stacionalization in weather like summer, but we would also have to see what might happen in the colder months, like December, is the shop going to face a very hard situation during that month? let´s see.

##Stadistics June
The amount of information we have can be so big that even without studying, all the people knows that during June we have hot weather almost in every part of the world, but when we use confident sources of information we can not just validate, make a decision through it, so we have 1700 days from June in different years, and we can validate that the average temperature is 74.94 which is not the best, but its an acceptable weather to be in the water and do some surfing. In addition, we´ve seen that the lowest temperature shown in our database in June is 64 and the maximum is 85. With that being said, it is also important to mention that our standard deviation is 3.2 which means we can guarantee that we won´t be moving a lot from our average temperature.

##Stadistics December
Similar to what was done for June, we analysed the data for December months throught the years. First thing it comes to our mind when we think in December is snow, cold weather, skateboarding, etc. But this is not the case for our surf shop because the temperatures are not that low in comparisson.
We see an average temperature of 71.04 and a standard desviation of 3.74 which is a little bit higher that in June, the main reason of that is that our minimum temperature is 56, which is a lot more colder that our minimun in June. In the other hand, we have a maximum value for this month of 83.

##Summary and opinion
We´ve seen 2 different months, one is considered to be the best in terms of sales and the other one can be estimated with the lower sales every year, however I would approve the surf shop since this is a stacionalization issue, evene if we don´t sell that much in December, there will be always people who enjoy to be in coold wather for a bit before christmas. Similar with the Jacket or sweater shops, they don´t sell a lot in summer but during winter the sales increase so much that it doesn´t even matter that much what happends at the en of the year.
